=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the BMC BladeLogic web services to run a CLI Command on
    a BladeLogic App Server using SOAP calls. After authenticating with username,
    password, and app server location, the handler starts making SOAP calls to 
    configure the CLI tunnel. It starts by making a login call with the
    BladeLogic username and password. It then takes the session id from the
    response (to help authenticate all future requests) and then assumes the
    role that was specified in the info values. After all the authentication is
    finished, the CLI command is sent with the name space, command name, and any
    non-empty arguments. Finally the response string from the command will be 
    returned from the SOAP response.
